      #### Cookies and Tracking technologies

      We use automatically collected information and other information collected on our Services through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Services, such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Services and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Services. You can obtain more information about cookies by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

      Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the services you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time, but if we do so in the future, we will describe how in this Policy.
      You can instruct your browser to block all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services.

      Cookies we use:
      - *Authentication cookies* to tell us when you´re logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features such as your account information and to edit your account settings.
      - *Security and site integrity cookies* to support or enable security features to help keep COS safe and secure. For example, they enable us to remember when you are logged into a secure area of the Service and help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you.
      - *Localization cookies* to help us provide a localized experience. For example, we may store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so you will see the site in your preferred language.
      - *Site features and service cookies* to provide functionality that help us deliver products and Service. For example, cookies help you log in by pre-filling fields. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to help us provide you and others with social plugins and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others.
      - *Analytics and research cookies* to understand, improve, and research products and Service, including when you access the Service and related Services and apps from a computer or mobile device.
