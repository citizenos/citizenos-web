1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,640
The way that the system currently functions

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,280
is built on traditions and the way that things have

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,140
always been.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,300
It's an online collaborative decision-making tool,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,660
which basically means that if you have

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,820
many people that want to discuss, propose arguments,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,660
decide, vote on things together -

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,060
they no longer have to meet in the same physical space.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,300
Often that would be impossible

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,200
because there's too many of them or

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,880
they are too geographically spread out.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,560
We have been using Citizen OS

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,360
for a simple organizational task, that

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,800
where we need our supervisory board members,

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,480
who are around the world sometimes,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,620
and not always physically available,

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,080
to review our internal policy documents.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
The only way for us to move

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,200
forward as a civilization is to learn to

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,160
really make use of that new quality of connectedness.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,800
Citizen OS enables that.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,020
You can bring a big number of people,

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,860
you can decide on things, on petitions,

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,380
on decisions, on documents.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,440
For a non-profit organization, for a civic movement,

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,260
for a village municipality.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,620
Up to the level of a national government

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,760
or even the citizens of a planet.

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,900
There's no upper limit

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,860
other than, yeah, the planet.

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,920
We are a part of the democracy festivals network,

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
so that means that

33
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:45,941
in our festival, the Opinion Festival, we hope to

34
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,952
develop our opinion culture in Estonia.

35
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:52,960
Citizen OS could help us on a new

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,968
level, to achieve better quality

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,500
discussions in Opinion Festival.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,480
It's a flavour of things to come. Or

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,740
it shows us what technology enables

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,640
in the information society, where

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,400
you can actually get the participation of

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,460
big, big numbers of people

43
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,420
to jointly come together and change things.
