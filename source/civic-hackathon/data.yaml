            ## The hackathon:{ .pt-5 }
            At the Citizen OS Civic Hackathon, university students will have the opportunity to “hack” civic engagement and discussions in both the online and offline sphere, through a fun, hands-on and co-created experience.

            You will work in teams of 3-5 students to research, define and pitch solutions for civic engagement, collective discussions and deliberation.

            Open to all university students with an interest in civic engagement, and a wish to connect with other like-minded students and gain new skills (such as design thinking, co-creation and user research).

            “Hacked” solutions can be presented in any format, and can be either digital or physical. Some possible presentation formats include, but are not limited to:

            - Storyboards / stories
            - Sketches / wireframes
            - Digital prototypes
            - Physical prototypes (clay, paper, wood, etc.)
            - Plays / scripts
            - Cards / board games
            - A poster / advert / promotional video

            Participants and mentors can deliberate on the evaluation process (for example whether the idea is clear, sustainable, viable, etc.) and come up with the evaluation criteria themselves.


            ## Who we’re looking for:{ .pt-5 }
            - Students who are currently enrolled in Bachelor and Master level programmes.
            - Participants who are involved in an active civic engagement project or idea.

            ## What you’ll get out of it:{ .pt-5 }
            - Learn to conduct effective user research.
            - Practice co-creation and design thinking.
            - Understand and contribute to open source solutions.

            ## Other important details:{ .pt-5 }
            The civic hackathon will be held at the Citizen OS office located in Telliskivi Creative City, Telliskivi 60a/3, Tallinn 10412, Estonia, EU.

            We encourage all participants to attend the full three days (including the Friday 18 Feb intro day). However, if you are unable to attend the Friday session due to study/work commitments, it will be possible to receive the brief and form your team online asynchronously, at a time that suits you that day.

            No prizes will be awarded, but all participants will be compensated for lunch costs on Sat 19 – Sun 20 Feb. On Friday 18 Feb there will be snacks available.

            Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the format of the hackathon is subject to change and may become a fully online event.
