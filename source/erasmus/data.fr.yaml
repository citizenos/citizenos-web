      ## Learning By Doing

      Our Digital Transformation for Civic Engagement youth exchange program will train up Europe’s next generation of leaders in civic engagement project design and participatory leadership, through innovative and engaging methods.

      Across a period of nine days, from 17-25 August 2021, five young people from six participating countries will have the opportunity to design and implement solutions to real-life civic engagement problems within a fictional, democratically-led organisation. They will act as board members of the organisation, working to solve the leadership problems they’re confronted with, while supporting and inspiring their project teams along the way.

      Participants will leave the program having a solid practical experience of designing effective civic engagement projects, as well as a sound understanding of how an organisation’s leaders can democratically engage their members in co-developing its Strategy and Action Plan. The application of technological tools will be a key focus of the program, with participants learning to apply such tools in effective and inclusive engagement processes.

      The programme is organised by Foundation Citizen OS and funded with support from the European European Solidarity Corps Erasmus+ programme. It is being developed and delivered in partnership with six organisations from the six participating countries:

      - [Citizen OS, Estonia](https://citizenos.com/about-us/)
      - [GEYC, Romania](https://www.geyc.ro/p/about-us.html)

      - [Sdruzhenie Alternativi International, Bulgaria](https://alternativibg.org/)
      - [Coconut Luxembourg, Luxembourg](http://thecocoworld.com/)
