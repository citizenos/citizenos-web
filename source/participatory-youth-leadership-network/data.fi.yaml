      # Citizens Bridge

      Led by a core team of Indian citizens, the Citizens Bridge project’s vision is to bridge the socio-economic and geographical gaps that prevent inclusion in deliberations about data ethics in India.

      ## We are on the lookout for:

      A volunteer to fill the role of **communication specialist** (managing our social media, radio or television campaigns) as a member of the project's core team.

      *Prior experience is not a requirement, candidates who are looking to gain experience are most welcome to apply. The role requires a commitment of 1-2 hours per week.*

      # The Participatory Youth Leadership Network{ .pt-5 }

      The Citizens Bridge project is a collaboration between Participatory Youth Leadership Network and actors from civil society in India.

      ## An Invitation to Collaborate{ .pt-5 }

      Youth organisations of India and beyond, we invite you to collaborate in the development of a new community of practice in India – the Participatory Youth Leadership Network (PYLN).

      ## About the Network{ .pt-5 }

      The Participatory Youth Leadership Network is a dedicated network for youth organisations all across India to collaborate and share best practice in the areas of participatory leadership and civic engagement.

      As part of the network, members will gain valuable insights, skills, knowledge and contacts to help achieve their youth organisation’s goals in the most innovative and democratic ways.

      The network will be divided into two parts – external collaboration and internal collaboration.

      External collaboration involves a comprehensive programme of free webinars, workshops, training sessions and networking on topics such as inclusive leadership, constructive argumentation, theory of change and values-centred approaches. This programme will be attended by youth organisations in India, Citizen OS and our international contributors.

      Internal collaboration involves organisations forming their own steering groups and deciding their own agendas using the civic tools provided by Citizen OS Foundation. However, the use of the Citizen OS platform is strictly voluntary, members are free to use any platform that they mutually agree upon.

      ## Network Members{ .pt-5 }

      Membership is open to all organisations that work towards youth empowerment and/or youth engagement in India, as well as youth leaders (individuals). There is no age restriction for community members.

      Anyone from the member organisations (including volunteers and interns) are welcome to collaborate with us. Certificates of participation will also available upon request.

      ## Program Contributors{ .pt-5 }

      International contributors who would like to use this opportunity to reflect upon or share best practices are welcome to participate.

      ## The Future{ .pt-5 }

      We are looking at developing a more global network in the future.

      ## The Background{ .pt-5 }

      Currently, both India and Estonia are making significant progress in the area of e-governance projects. However, our analysis has been that there is a gap in India and Estonia and across the world, when it comes to technology-driven citizen participation that is truly 'bottom-up'.

      The Participatory Youth Leadership Network will look at broader applications of design thinking and value-sensitive design to address gaps in participatory leadership.

      ## Platform Objectives{ .pt-5 }

      The overall objective of the Participatory Youth Leadership Network is to enable structured collaboration between member organisations on the topics of participation, inclusive leadership and civic engagement.

      This collaboration occurs through:

      - Planning and gap analysis workshops
      - Leadership and argumentation training
      - Project presentations and feedback sessions

      ## Platform Values{ .pt-5 }

      **Equal opportunities for participation**

      The creation of equal opportunities for participation for all citizens, and bridging participation gaps that may occur as a direct or indirect consequence of marginalisation.

      **Empowering youth leaders**

      Empowering youth leaders through shared knowledge, mentorship and facilitated collaboration with the youth organisations they are part of.

      **Bringing different opinions together**

      Making democratic collective decisions about the development of the network, building trust and communication among members.

      ## Threat Mapping Workshop, our most recent webinar{ .pt-5 }

      This workshop aims at deepening the political discourse by allowing organisations to evaluate who their main opponents are and by what means their opponents can challenge them or threaten their initiative.

      Additionally, the workshop also provides strategies for mediation and compromise.
