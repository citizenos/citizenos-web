      Help us improve the Citizen OS platform as a volunteer. Whether you are a developer, translator, researcher, designer, hacktivist or journalist - join us!

      #### Join the Civic Hacktivist Community.

      We run a global community for civic tech and participatory democracy enthusiasts. It’s a space for the exchange of knowledge and ideas about e-democracy and collaborative decision-making, and everyone’s welcome. [Find out more ](/community/).

      #### Help translate.

      If Citizen OS platform doesn’t yet support your language and you'd like to join our volunteer translators' team, [please get in touch](mailto:translations@citizenos.com).

      Translating the Citizen OS platform into a new language is easy; many volunteers work with us every day. [Check it out](https://crowdin.com/project/citizenos-fe)!

      #### Help develop Open Source software.

      Are you a developer or designer, to whom the future of online decision-making is a topic close to heart?

      If you have ideas on how to improve or add functionality to our open source code, please [share it with us on GitHub](https://github.com/citizenos).

      #### Help with research.

      If you are working in the field of e-democracy, we would love to meet you or publish your works on our blog. Please [email our Head of Partnerships](mailto:sara@citizenos.com).

      #### Help in other areas.

      With any other offers, please [contact our Head of Partnerships](mailto:sara@citizenos.com).
