            ## Whatâ€™s the issue?{ .pt-5 }

            At Citizen OS, we would like to live in a world where we can participate in a respectful manner, as well as make collaborative decisions about topics that directly impact our lives and well-being.

            In order to make this happen, we are developing an open-source platform for people and communities who can join global discussions.

            We are also initiating civic hackathons, summer and winter schools, democracy festivals and other exciting projects with our awesome partners. Everything that we create and develop, we give away to people and communities.

            We believe that democracy and civic participation should be free for everyone.
