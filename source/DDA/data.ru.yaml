      ## Why Defend Democracy? { .pt-5 }

      Over recent years, rising inequality, war, natural disasters and the Covid 19 pandemic have spurred the **decline of democratic governance around the world.**

      But everywhere we look, **inspiring activists have been standing up** for human rights and environmental protection — **demonstrating the vital importance of civil society** in these challenging times.

      **To support and empower even more people to take action** in the face of the democratic decline, we have developed the Democracy Defenders Accelerator. This 10-month programme will **bring together young activists from diverse backgrounds** to learn, exchange and grow together.

      And together, **we will become the defenders of democracy.**
  agenda:
    title: What is the DDA?
    text: |
      The Democracy Defenders Accelerator aims to create a world in which **active young citizens are empowered** to **defend the principles of an open society, democratic values ​​and a well-functioning civil society.**

      In this immersive, hands-on programme, participants will **learn how to design and deliver civic engagement projects** and practise **participatory leadership skills** — through both the running of a fictional organisation and real-life projects. The entire ten-month learning process will be **supported by mentors and facilitators.**


      ## The **four main goals** of this programme are: { .pt-5 }

      - **Open Society and Democratic Values:** Discuss and explore democratic values, as well as potential threats and opportunities to democracy in international contexts.
      - **Empower Civil Society:** Design highly innovative, bottom-up civic engagement initiatives. Gain the confidence to test these ideas in real life to solve communities’ issues on a local, national or global level.
      - **Qualitative Participatory Leadership:** Learn about participatory leadership principles and values by practising leading a (fictional) organisation.
      - **More Collaborative Decision-Making:** Learn different decision-making methods to be able to make better collaborative decisions.


      ## The DDA consists of 160 contact hours, made up of workshops and mentoring sessions: { .pt-5 }
