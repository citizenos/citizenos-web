  title: Seeing how many people have voted so far
  text: |
    Anyone can see how many people have voted, both during and after the vote. This is displayed as an anonymous numerical result.

    ![Screenshot of the platform.](/assets/images/help/sendtofollowup.png)

    To see this:
    1. Go into the relevant topic, and make sure you are in the “Vote” tab, shown at the top.
    1. To the right of “Cast your vote” or “Voting results” (depending on whether the vote is still ongoing), you will see the number of votes cast.

    In a private topic, you will see two numbers: “X/X votes counted”. The first number (on the left) shows how many people have voted and the second number (on the right) shows how many people have joined the topic in total.

    In a public topic, you will see just one number “X votes counted”. This is the number of people who have voted so far.

  title: Why admins can’t see who has voted while a vote is in progress
  text: |
    The admin(s) of a topic can see who has voted, but only once the voting period has ended. It is not possible to see who has voted while a vote is still running.

    **Tip:**
    It is possible to see who has joined the topic in the Activity Feed, which is located below “My account” in the main menu. There, the names of everyone who has joined or commented on the topic so far are displayed, along with the date and time they did so. The date and time of votes cast are displayed too, but anonymously.

    **Why we protect anonymity during the vote.**
    At Citizen OS we believe that not voting can be a means of expressing opinion. For example, if someone does not agree with the question or the options available to vote upon, they may actively decide not to vote. If the vote administrator tries to incite them to vote, this could deprive them of their freedom to express their views through not voting. This information is kept confidential in government-run votes for the same reason.

    When the voting period ends, the admin(s) of a topic can download a summary report with the voting results and voter details. The voter details will show as their Citizen OS username or personal ID (name and ID number), depending on how the vote was cast (with or without e-ID).

    This means that it is possible for the admin(s) to identify who has voted and how, once the vote is complete.

  title: Delegating your vote
  text: |
    It is possible to delegate your vote to someone else who is a member of the same topic. This means that however the person you delegated to votes, the same vote will be cast in your name too. The delegated person won’t be aware that you have delegated your vote to them, unless you tell them yourself.

    To delegate your vote:
    1. Go into the topic in which the vote is taking place.
    1. Under the voting options, click on the button “Delegate your vote”.
    1. In the pop-up window, type the name of your chosen topic member, then select their name when it appears in the drop-down.
    1. Click “Delegate vote”.

    The person you have chosen to delegate to will now be shown under the voting options in the topic.

    If you change your mind at any point before the vote is over, you can click “revoke your delegation”, then submit a vote yourself.

    Vote delegation will, however, only be possible if the admin(s) have enabled vote delegation when setting up the vote. If they have not, the “Delegate your vote” button won’t appear.

    In Estonia, digital signature voting results can be downloaded with a CSV file (the “human readable” option) or without a CSV file (the “machine readable” option).

    **What is a CSV file?**

    A CSV file is a “comma-separated values'' file, which presents data in a tabular format. This can be opened and read using any spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets).

    Each voter’s data is displayed in a separate line in the table. It shows the date and time they voted, their name, their personal identification code, the options they voted for and the file name of each option they voted for.

    Here is an example of a line in a vote CSV file:

    *Thu Jan 21 2021 13:51:07 GMT + 0200 (Eastern European Standard Time), PNOEE-112233444, JAAK ERVIN SINGLE-GATE, "Two, Three", "Two.html, Three.html"*

    Inline votes allow those with “admin” and “edit” rights for the topic to democratically decide on the specifics of the topic text. For example, by voting on three different options for what to change a particular word/sentence/paragraph to.

    To use inline voting:

    - Select the relevant words in the topic text, while in edit mode.
    - In the pop-up, select “Create voting”.
    - Add an explanation of what the vote is about, define the voting options and click “Start voting”.
    - The relevant text will now be highlighted green.
    - Other admins will now be able to submit their votes, by clicking on the green highlighted text while in edit mode.
    - Once everyone has voted, click “close voting” in the inline vote pop-up.
    - You can choose to automatically replace the original text with the most voted option if you wish.
    - To view the vote results, click on the green highlighted text.
