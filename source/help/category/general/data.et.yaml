    Emails notifications are sent automatically in the three following situations:

    - **When a person is added to a group**, they will receive an invite via email. (Note to admins: we therefore recommend posting at least one topic in the group before inviting members, as being invited to an empty group can cause confusion.)
    - **When a person is invited to a topic**, they will receive an invite via email.
    - **When a new topic is added to a group**, an invitation email will be sent to all existing group members.
    - **When an argument or comment is flagged as inappropriate**, the topic administrator/moderator and the original poster will be notified via email.

    There are no email notifications in any other situations. Therefore, if you want to notify topic members of any other activity (such as a topic now being open for voting, for example), you will need to contact them yourself to let them know.
