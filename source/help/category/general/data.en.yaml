    title: Automatic notifications
    text: |
        Emails notifications are sent automatically in the three following situations:

        - **When a person is added to a group**, they will receive an invite via email. (Note to admins: we therefore recommend posting at least one topic in the group before inviting members, as being invited to an empty group can cause confusion.)
        - **When a person is invited to a topic**, they will receive an invite via email.
        - **When a new topic is added to a group**, an invitation email will be sent to all existing group members.
        - **When an argument or comment is flagged as inappropriate**, the topic administrator/moderator and the original poster will be notified via email.

        There are no email notifications in any other situations. Therefore, if you want to notify topic members of any other activity (such as a topic now being open for voting, for example), you will need to contact them yourself to let them know.

    text: |
        The platform is only accessible online, with no “offline mode”.
        This is to ensure that multiple users can engage with a topic at the same time, and will all see the same content.

        Use the activity feed to keep track of new activity in your topics and groups. It shows activity such as accepted invites, topic contributions, changes to access rights and more.

        To view the feed, click on “Activity Feed” at the top of the main menu.

        You can filter your activity feed using the dropdown box located at the top.
