  text: |
    - **Why create a group?** Quicker sharing. All members of a group will be automatically added to any new topic created for that group. No need to send invite links or add users one-by-one.
    - **Quicker unsharing.** By removing a user from a group, they will automatically lose access to all topics shared with that group. No need to remove them manually from each topic one-by-one.
    - **Tidier topic management.** Having a group means that it is easier to access all topics shared with that group in one location. Think of it like a folder for topics relevant to that group.
    - **Easier rights administration.** You can bulk edit users' rights to a topic, if those rights were received via a Group. For example, you could change the whole group’s access rights from ‘edit’ to ‘view’ in one click.

  title: Checking if email invites bounced
  text: |
    It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

    In the case of a group invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the group’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

    The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

    **Please note:**
    - Only groups for which you have already accepted the invitation will be listed. If you have been invited to but not yet joined a group, it will not show. To join the group, follow the link in the email invitation you were originally sent.
    - If a group you have previously joined or created is not showing in the list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access groups using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).

    By inviting a group to a topic, all members of the group will be invited to join. It also means that the topic will show up under the relevant group name in the “My Groups” dashboard.
    There are three ways to do this:

    *Either*

    1. Go into the relevant topic.
    1. Click on “invite users” in the “Options” menu. (Right sidebar on desktop, or in the options menu tab on mobile).
    1. Type the name of the relevant group and select it when it appears.
    1. Choose the access rights you would like to give to members of that group, from the dropdown list.
    1. Click “Save topic and send invite”.

    *Or*

    1. In the “My Topics” dashboard, find the relevant topic and select it.
    1. Navigate to the grey “Group list” bar, displayed underneath the “General information” box on the dashboard.
    1. Click on “add”.
    1. In the pop-up window, search for the name of the relevant group and select it when it appears.
    1. Choose the access rights you would like to give to members of that group, from the dropdown list.
    1. Click “Save topic and send invite”.

    *Or*

    1. In the “My Groups” dashboard, find the relevant group and select it.
    1. Click on “add”, which you will find under “topics” and “topics list” for that group.
    1. In the pop-up window, search for the name of the relevant topic and select it when it appears.
    1. Choose the access rights you would like to give members of that group over the topic, from the dropdown list.
    1. Click “Save group”.
    1. The topic will now appear in the topics list for that group, and automatic invitations will be sent to members of the group.

    *Tip:*
    You can also invite a group automatically when you first create a topic, by creating the topic within the relevant group right from the start. In your “My Groups” dashboard, find the relevant group, and click on “add” under “topics” and “topics list”. In the pop-up, see “Create a new topic”. Invitations will be sent as soon as you press “Create”.

  title: Changing the rights of group participants
  text: |
    There are two different sets of rights with a group: group management rights, and group topic access rights.

    **Group management rights** refer to actions relating to the settings of the group itself. **Group topic access rights** refer to the level of access that group members have for a topic to which the group has been invited.

    See [Understanding group user rights](/help/groups/understanding-group-user-rights) for more information on what these rights mean, and how they relate to each other.

    Here is how to edit these different types of rights.

    **Group management rights**

    To change the group management rights of a group member:

    - Click on the relevant group in your “My Groups “ dashboard.
    - Click to expand the grey “User list” bar.
    - Next to the user’s name, in the dropdown box under “Rights”, select your preferred level of rights.

    **Group topic access rights**

    To edit the group access rights for a particular topic:

    - Click on the relevant group in your “My Groups “ dashboard.
    - Click to expand the grey “topics list” bar, which is displayed underneath the “General information” box on the dashboard.
    - Next to the topic’s name, in the dropdown box under “Rights”, select your preferred access level.

    Or

    - Go into the relevant topic.
    - Click on “Manage participants” in the “Options” menu. (Right sidebar on desktop, or in the options menu tab on mobile).
    - Click on the “Groups” tab in the pop-up window that appears.
    - Next to the topic’s name, in the dropdown box under “Rights”, select your preferred access level.

    **Note:** Changing these rights will bulk edit the topic access rights of almost all members of your group for that particular topic. However, the initiator of the topic will retain “admin” rights, and any members who have had rights manually assigned will retain these if they were assigned a higher level of rights than the group rights (more on this [here](/help/groups/understanding-group-user-rights)).


    To find out how to check and manually edit the topic access rights of individual users within the group, see [Changing the rights of topic participants](/help/topics/changing-the-rights-of-topic-participants).

    **Private topics and groups can only be accessed using a Citizen OS account which is registered with the same email address to which the original invitation was sent.**

    Follow these two key steps for topic/group access:
    1. **Click on the link in the invitation email** you received for joining the group or topic.
    1. **Login or register using the same email address the invitation was sent to**, according to either of the two scenarios below:
        - **If you already have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, log in using that account.
        *OR*
        - **If you do not yet have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, register a new one with the correct address.

    A few additional tips:
    - **If you are logging in with a social login such as Google or Facebook**, this will only work if your social media account is registered with the same email address as the one with which you were invited to the group or topic.
    - **The option to log in with your ID-card/Mobile ID** (applicable to Estonian ID-cards) will only appear if you have previously created a Citizen OS account with the email address to which the invitation was sent, and have previously digitally signed at least one document through that account. If this is not the case, you will need to log in using your email address instead.
    - **If you are unsure what email address your Citizen OS account is registered with**, or to which account you are currently logged in, you can check this in “My Account” next to your profile avatar in the main menu.

    There are two different sets of rights with a group: group management rights, and group topic access rights.

    To find out how to edit these rights, see [“Changing the rights of group participants”](/help/groups/changing-the-rights-of-group-participants).

    Here is an explanation of what these rights mean, and how they relate to each other.

    __**Group management rights**__

    Group participants can be [assigned different levels of group management rights:](/help/groups/changing-the-admin-rights-of-group-members) “admin”, or “participant”. These rights levels determine the actions users can take in relation to the management of the group - i.e. editing the group settings.

    With “admin” rights, users can:

    - Add topics into the group (i.e. give group members access to these topics)
    - Create new topics within the group
    - View users (including email addresses)
    - Invite users to the group via email, URL, QR code or sharing to Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin
    - Change group members’ group management rights
    - Change group topic access rights
    - Change the name of the group
    - Delete the group
    - Leave the group

    _Note: It is only possible to add topics into a group if you have “admin” rights for the topic itself, including for public topics._

    With “participant” rights, users can:

    - View users (user names only)
    - Access topics shared to the group (with their level of access varying, depending on their topic rights)
    - Leave the group

    __**Group topic access rights**__

    Group topic access rights refer to the level of access that group members have for a topic to which the group has been invited. **To find out what the different access levels mean, see [Understanding topic user rights](/help/topics/understanding-topic-user-rights).**

    Changing group topic access rights will bulk edit the access rights of almost all members of your group for that particular topic, aside from the exceptions listed below.

    After bulk editing the topic access rights of the whole group, it is possible to manually, individually edit the topic access rights of certain group members, via the topic’s “user list”.  (For example, if you want to set the whole group to “participant”, but then manually change a few group members to be “admin” with you).

    Below are the aforementioned exceptions to group rights. These members rights will not be automatically affected when the group rights are changed:

    - The initiator of the topic will retain their topic “admin” rights.
    - Any other users whose topic access rights have previously been individually manually edited will also retain their previously specified level of topic access rights, if they were assigned a “higher level” of rights than those given to the group. Two examples:
        * If a user was manually assigned “admin” rights, but the group rights were then changed to “editor”, that user will retain “admin” rights.
        * If a user was manually assigned “participant” rights, but the group rights were then changed to “editor”, that user will now also have edit rights.

    **Interrelation between group and topic rights**

    Group management rights and topic access rights are not related. Group management rights relate purely to actions relating to the management of the group itself, while topic access rights relate purely to group members’ levels of topic access.

    However, group topic access rights and individual user access rights do interrelate. Individual user topic access rights are more “powerful” than group topic access rights. (For example, if the whole group has been given “participant” rights to a topic, but a particular user has been individually given “admin” rights, then that user will be able to carry out “admin” actions for the topic).
