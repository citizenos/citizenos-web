  text: |
    - **Why create a group?** Quicker sharing. All members of a group will be automatically added to any new topic created for that group. No need to send invite links or add users one-by-one.
    - **Quicker unsharing.** By removing a user from a group, they will automatically lose access to all topics shared with that group. No need to remove them manually from each topic one-by-one.
    - **Tidier topic management.** Having a group means that it is easier to access all topics shared with that group in one location. Think of it like a folder for topics relevant to that group.
    - **Easier rights administration.** You can bulk edit users' rights to a topic, if those rights were received via a Group. For example, you could change the whole group’s access rights from ‘edit’ to ‘view’ in one click.

  title: Checking if email invites bounced
  text: |
    It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

    In the case of a group invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the group’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

    The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

    **Please note:**
    - Only groups for which you have already accepted the invitation will be listed. If you have been invited to but not yet joined a group, it will not show. To join the group, follow the link in the email invitation you were originally sent.
    - If a group you have previously joined or created is not showing in the list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access groups using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).

  title: Changing the admin rights of group members
  text: |
    If a member of a group has “admin” rights at the group level, this means they can change the group settings. For example, changing the rights of other group members, inviting users to the group, adding the group to a topic, or closing and deleting topics the group is part of.

    To make a member of a group admin:
    1. Click on the relevant group in your “My Groups “ dashboard.
    1. Click to expand the grey “User list” bar, which is displayed underneath the “General information” box on the dashboard.
    1. Next to the user’s name, in the dropdown box under “Rights”, change their access from “read” to admin.

    **Please note:**
    Group rights are only relevant to group-related settings. Topic rights are set separately by the topic admin and are not affected by group rights.

  title: Troubleshooting “no permission to access”
  text: |
    **Private topics and groups can only be accessed using a Citizen OS account which is registered with the same email address to which the original invitation was sent.**

    Follow these two key steps for topic/group access:
    1. **Click on the link in the invitation email** you received for joining the group or topic.
    1. **Login or register using the same email address the invitation was sent to**, according to either of the two scenarios below:
        - **If you already have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, log in using that account.
        *OR*
        - **If you do not yet have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, register a new one with the correct address.

    A few additional tips:
    - **If you are logging in with a social login such as Google or Facebook**, this will only work if your social media account is registered with the same email address as the one with which you were invited to the group or topic.
    - **The option to log in with your ID-card/Mobile ID** (applicable to Estonian ID-cards) will only appear if you have previously created a Citizen OS account with the email address to which the invitation was sent, and have previously digitally signed at least one document through that account. If this is not the case, you will need to log in using your email address instead.
    - **If you are unsure what email address your Citizen OS account is registered with**, or to which account you are currently logged in, you can check this in “My Account” next to your profile avatar in the main menu.
