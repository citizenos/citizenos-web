    - **Why create a group?** Quicker sharing. All members of a group will be automatically added to any new topic created for that group. No need to send invite links or add users one-by-one.
    - **Quicker unsharing.** By removing a user from a group, they will automatically lose access to all topics shared with that group. No need to remove them manually from each topic one-by-one.
    - **Tidier topic management.** Having a group means that it is easier to access all topics shared with that group in one location. Think of it like a folder for topics relevant to that group.
    - **Easier rights administration.** You can bulk edit users' rights to a topic, if those rights were received via a Group. For example, you could change the whole group’s access rights from ‘edit’ to ‘view’ in one click.

  title: Checking if email invites bounced
  text: |
    It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

    In the case of a group invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the group’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

    The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

    To access all groups you have previously joined or created, click on “My Groups” in the main menu.

    Please note:
    - Only groups for which you have already accepted the invitation will be listed. If you have been invited to but not yet joined a group, it will not show. To join the group, follow the link in the email invitation you were originally sent.
    - If a group you have previously joined or created is not showing in the list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access groups using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).
