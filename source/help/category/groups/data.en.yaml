    title: Why create a group
    text: |
        - **Why create a group?** Quicker sharing. All members of a group will be automatically added to any new topic created for that group. No need to send invite links or add users one-by-one.
        - **Quicker unsharing.** By removing a user from a group, they will automatically lose access to all topics shared with that group. No need to remove them manually from each topic one-by-one.
        - **Tidier topic management.** Having a group means that it is easier to access all topics shared with that group in one location. Think of it like a folder for topics relevant to that group.
        - **Easier rights administration.** You can bulk edit users' rights to a topic, if those rights were received via a Group. For example, you could change the whole group’s access rights from ‘edit’ to ‘view’ in one click.

    title: Checking if email invites bounced
    text: |
        It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

        In the case of a group invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the group’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

        The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

        To access all groups you have previously joined or created, click on “My Groups” in the main menu.

        ![Screenshot of the platform.](/assets/images/help/mygroups.png)

        **Please note:**
        - Only groups for which you have already accepted the invitation will be listed. If you have been invited to but not yet joined a group, it will not show. To join the group, follow the link in the email invitation you were originally sent.
        - If a group you have previously joined or created is not showing in the list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access groups using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).

        1. Choose the access rights you would like to give to members of that group, from the dropdown list.

        *Or*

        1. In the “My Topics” dashboard, find the relevant topic and select it.
        1. Navigate to the grey “Group list” bar, displayed underneath the “General information” box on the dashboard.
        1. Click on “add”.
        1. In the pop-up window, search for the name of the relevant group and select it when it appears.

    title: Changing the admin rights of group members
    text: |
        If a member of a group has “admin” rights at the group level, this means they can change the group settings. For example, changing the rights of other group members, inviting users to the group, adding the group to a topic, or closing and deleting topics the group is part of.

        To make a member of a group admin:
        1. Click on the relevant group in your “My Groups “ dashboard.
        1. Click to expand the grey “User list” bar, which is displayed underneath the “General information” box on the dashboard.
        1. Next to the user’s name, in the dropdown box under “Rights”, change their access from “read” to admin.

        **Please note:**
        Group rights are only relevant to group-related settings. Topic rights are set separately by the topic admin and are not affected by group rights.
