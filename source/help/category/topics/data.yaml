        To access all topics you have previously joined or created, click on “My Topics” in the main menu.

        Please note:
        - Only topics for which you have already accepted the invitation will be listed. If you have been invited to but not yet joined a topic, it will not show. To join the topic, follow the link in the email invitation you were originally sent.
        - If a topic you have previously joined or created is not showing in the list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access topics using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).

        You can see who has been invited to or joined a topic as follows:
        1. Navigate to your “My Topics” dashboard via the main menu, listed under “Topics”.
        1. Click on the relevant topic name.
        1. Click to expand the grey “User list” bar, which is displayed underneath the “General information” box.
        1. The list shows everyone who has been invited, and what level of access rights they have, e.g. “admin” or “read”.
        1. If their invitation is greyed out and marked as “pending”, this means they have not yet accepted the invitation.

        It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

        In the case of a topic invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the topic’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

        The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

        You can add footnotes by clicking on the footnotes button in the centre of the text editor toolbar (above the topic text), while in edit mode. The footnotes button is in the form of an asterisk: *

        Be sure to place your cursor at the point in the text in which you want the footnote to appear, before clicking on the button.
