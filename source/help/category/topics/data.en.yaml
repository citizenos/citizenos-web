    text: |
        The way in which you find a topic will depend on whether you have previously joined it or not.

        **If you have not previously joined the topic:**
        1. Click on the link in the invitation email you have been sent.
        1. Log in using the same email address as the invitation email was sent to.
        1. You will be directed to the topic, and have now joined it.
        1. From now on, it will appear in your “My Topics” dashboard.

        ![Screenshot of the platform.](/assets/images/help/mytopics.png)

        **If you have previously joined the topic:**
        1. Click on “My Topics” in the main menu to go to your My Topics dashboard.
        1. Use the search bar or filters at the top to find the relevant topic.
        1. If a group you are a member of has been invited to the topic, you can also find the topic listed under the relevant group name in your “My Groups” dashboard.

        **Please note:**
        - If a topic you have previously joined or created is not showing in your "My Topics" list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access topics using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).

    text: |
        **Private topics and groups can only be accessed using a Citizen OS account which is registered with the same email address to which the original invitation was sent.**

        Follow these two key steps for topic/group access:
        1. **Click on the link in the invitation email** you received for joining the group or topic.
        1. **Login or register using the same email address the invitation was sent to**, according to either of the two scenarios below:
            - **If you already have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, log in using that account.
            *OR*
            - **If you do not yet have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, register a new one with the correct address.

        A few additional tips:
        - **If you are logging in with a social login such as Google or Facebook**, this will only work if your social media account is registered with the same email address as the one with which you were invited to the group or topic.
        - **The option to log in with your ID-card/Mobile ID** (applicable to Estonian ID-cards) will only appear if you have previously created a Citizen OS account with the email address to which the invitation was sent, and have previously digitally signed at least one document through that account. If this is not the case, you will need to log in using your email address instead.
        - **If you are unsure what email address your Citizen OS account is registered with**, or to which account you are currently logged in, you can check this in “My Account” next to your profile avatar in the main menu.

        You can see who has been invited to or joined a topic as follows:
        1. Navigate to your “My Topics” dashboard via the main menu, listed under “Topics”.
        1. Click on the relevant topic name.
        1. Click to expand the grey “User list” bar, which is displayed underneath the “General information” box.
        1. The list shows everyone who has been invited, and what level of access rights they have, e.g. “admin” or “read”.
        1. If their invitation is greyed out and marked as “pending”, this means they have not yet accepted the invitation.

    title: Checking if email invites bounced
    text: |
        It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

        In the case of a topic invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the topic’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

        The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

        - Select the relevant words in the topic text, while in edit mode.
        - In the pop-up, select “Create voting”.
        - Add an explanation of what the vote is about, define the voting options and click “Start voting”.
        - The relevant text will now be highlighted green.
        - Other admins will now be able to submit their votes, by clicking on the green highlighted text while in edit mode.
        - Once everyone has voted, click “close voting” in the inline vote pop-up.
        - You can choose to automatically replace the original text with the most voted option if you wish.
        - To view the vote results, click on the green highlighted text.
