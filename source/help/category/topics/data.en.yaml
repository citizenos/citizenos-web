    text: |
        The way in which you find a topic will depend on whether you have previously joined it or not.

        **If you have not previously joined the topic:**
        1. Click on the link in the invitation email you have been sent.
        1. Log in using the same email address as the invitation email was sent to.
        1. You will be directed to the topic, and have now joined it.
        1. From now on, it will appear in your “My Topics” dashboard.

        ![Screenshot of the platform.](/assets/images/help/mytopics.png)

        **If you have previously joined the topic:**
        1. Click on “My Topics” in the main menu to go to your My Topics dashboard.
        1. Use the search bar or filters at the top to find the relevant topic.
        1. If a group you are a member of has been invited to the topic, you can also find the topic listed under the relevant group name in your “My Groups” dashboard.

        **Please note:**
        - If a topic you have previously joined or created is not showing in your "My Topics" list, it may be that you are signed into the wrong Citizen OS account. If you have another Citizen OS account, try looking there. (You can only access topics using the Citizen OS account that is linked to the same email address as the one to which the original topic invitation email was sent).

    text: |
        **Private topics and groups can only be accessed using a Citizen OS account which is registered with the same email address to which the original invitation was sent.**

        Follow these two key steps for topic/group access:
        1. **Click on the link in the invitation email** you received for joining the group or topic.
        1. **Login or register using the same email address the invitation was sent to**, according to either of the two scenarios below:
            - **If you already have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, log in using that account.
            *OR*
            - **If you do not yet have a Citizen OS account registered with the email address** your invitation was sent to, register a new one with the correct address.

        A few additional tips:
        - **If you are logging in with a social login such as Google or Facebook**, this will only work if your social media account is registered with the same email address as the one with which you were invited to the group or topic.
        - **The option to log in with your ID-card/Mobile ID** (applicable to Estonian ID-cards) will only appear if you have previously created a Citizen OS account with the email address to which the invitation was sent, and have previously digitally signed at least one document through that account. If this is not the case, you will need to log in using your email address instead.
        - **If you are unsure what email address your Citizen OS account is registered with**, or to which account you are currently logged in, you can check this in “My Account” next to your profile avatar in the main menu.

        You can see who has been invited to or joined a topic as follows:

        1. Click on the relevant topic name.
        1. Click to expand the grey “User list” bar, which is displayed underneath the “General information” box.
        1. The list shows everyone who has been invited, and what level of access rights they have, e.g. “admin” or “read”.
        1. If their invitation is greyed out and marked as “pending”, this means they have not yet accepted the invitation.

    title: Checking if email invites bounced
    text: |
        It is not possible to check whether an invitation has “bounced” on the Citizen OS platform.

        In the case of a topic invitation having been sent to an email address that does not actually exist, the invited member will still be included in the topic’s user list as “Pending”. This is because the system cannot recognise that the email invitation has bounced.

        The only way to find out whether an email address you invited may have bounced is to send an email to that address yourself, and see whether you get a “mailbox error” automatic reply.

        A topic admin can change the level of rights that other participants have in that topic.
        Rights can be set to either “admin”, “edit”, “read” or “none”.

        There are three ways to change a topic participant's rights.

        **Either:**

        - Go into the relevant topic.
        - Click on “Manage participants” in the “Options” menu. (Right sidebar on desktop, or in the options menu tab on mobile).
        - In the pop-up window, find the relevant user in the “Participants” or “Invited” tab.
        - Click on the dropdown box next to their username, and select the desired level of rights from the list.
        - You can also bulk edit the rights level of all participants within a group, in the “Groups” tab, if a group has already been added to the topic.
        - Close the window. The change will automatically be saved.

        **Or:**

        - In the “My Topics” dashboard, find the relevant topic and select it.
        - Click to expand the grey “User list” bar, which is the last grey bar underneath the “General information” box on the dashboard.
        - Click on the dropdown box next to the relevant username, and select the desired level of rights.
        - You can also bulk edit the rights level of all participants within a group, in the “Groups list”. You will find this just above the “User list” on the dashboard.
        - Any changes will automatically be saved.

        **Or:**

        - You can bulk edit the topic access rights of a whole group, if the group has been invited to join the topic.
        - See [Understanding group user rights](/help/groups/understanding-group-user-rights) and [Changing the rights of group participants](/help/groups/changing-the-rights-of-group-participants) for more information on this.

        To use inline voting:

        - Select the relevant words in the topic text, while in edit mode.
        - In the pop-up, select “Create voting”.
        - Add an explanation of what the vote is about, define the voting options and click “Start voting”.
        - The relevant text will now be highlighted green.
        - Other admins will now be able to submit their votes, by clicking on the green highlighted text while in edit mode.
        - Once everyone has voted, click “close voting” in the inline vote pop-up.
        - You can choose to automatically replace the original text with the most voted option if you wish.

        Those with “admin” and “edit” rights for a topic can co-create the topic text - collaboratively building the text as a group, remotely and asynchronously.

        This is possible through three features: group editing, comments and in-line voting, all of which can be accessed in edit mode.

        **Group editing** simply means that all those with “admin” and “edit” rights are able to edit the text. If one person writes something, another person can edit it, add to it, or remove it. This feature is automatically enabled for all admins.

        **Comments** allow all those with “admin” and “edit” rights to discuss the content of the text, ask questions or suggest alternative text.

        To add a comment:

        - Select the relevant text.
        - Select “Add new comment on selection” from the pop-up box.
        - Insert your comment, and add a suggested alternative text if you wish using the toggle.

        To view a comment, click on the speech bubble symbol which appears next to the relevant text. Comments are only visible to those with “admin” and “edit” rights, and are visible in both view and edit modes. To reply, edit or delete a comment, or to accept a suggested text change, you must be in edit mode.

        **Inline votes** allow those with “admin” and “edit” rights to democratically decide on the specifics of the topic text. For more guidance on creating inline votes [see here](/help/topics/creating-an-inline-vote-in-a-topic-text).

        - Edit topic (title, topic text, etc.)
        - Add hashtags and categories
        - Add/manage attachments

        **With “admin” rights, users can do all of the above plus:**

        - Change topic status (send it to voting and follow-up, close it, delete it)
        - Make topic public/private
        - Invite users via email
        - Invite an existing group
        - Share an invite to topic via URL, QR code, FB, LinkedIn and Twitter

        - Duplicate topic.

        **With “None” rights,** users cannot access the topic at all. This can be used when you do not want to remove a user(s) from a topic entirely, but want to temporarily suspend their access to it.

        **Note:** Please see [Understanding group user rights](/help/groups/understanding-group-user-rights) for more information on the interrelation between group rights and topic rights.
