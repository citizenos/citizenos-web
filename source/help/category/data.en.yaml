        Groups are groups of users. They are useful if you will be making decisions with the same group of people (such as a team, community or organisation) on multiple occasions. [The benefits of a group](/help/groups/why-create-a-group) include quicker sharing or unsharing of topics, a group folder containing all topics shared to those users, and easier rights administration.

        A Citizen OS “Topic” is the space in which discussion and voting on a particular subject takes place. In a topic, you can co-create a topic text, discuss the pros and cons, and vote on it. Topics can be public or private.

        This section covers general topic management and topic texts. For guidance on discussions or voting, see the [Discussions](/help/discussions) or [Voting](/help/voting) sections

        Use the discussion space to discuss both sides of a topic before it is voted on, or to crowdsource ideas for how to go forwards. Here you can post “pro” and “con” arguments, and reply or react to arguments made by others.
