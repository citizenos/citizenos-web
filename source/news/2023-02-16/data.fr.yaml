  The campaign motivates people to ask “Why?”, “What?” and “How?”. Voters can access guidance videos and content to help improve their theoretical knowledge around governance and other important political topics. The project also cooperates with the media, analysing election debates and raising awareness about populist tactics. Project activities include offering training courses to teachers and pupils to improve critical and analytical thinking around elections and political participation.

  “Our goal is to reach out to voters, media channels and politicians to support balanced and argument-based public debates, so that voters can make informed decisions,” commented Karoliina Tammel, Communications Manager for the “Smart Voter” project.

  Meelika Hirmo, our Communications Lead here at Citizen OS, explains: “While the campaign and its promotional materials are in Estonian, we want to encourage everyone to think about their local elections and debating culture. Can you recognise populistic statements and promises? Do voters and citizens get to participate meaningfully in making these important decisions? Are the debates and decision-making processes open and inclusive to various types of people and communities?”.

  “If you answered "no" or "not enough” to any of these questions, then you may want to consider taking your local, national or even international discussions and decision-making to a new level. The free-to-use Citizen OS platform is a great place to start inclusive and meaningful discussions with your fellow citizens,” she added.
