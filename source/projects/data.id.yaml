      Winter and Summer Schools.
    text: |
      The Digital Innovation for Civic Engagement Projects course is run in a partnership between us and Tallinn University, as part of their Summer and Winter School programmes. The 10-day course teaches members of communities and civic initiatives how to involve more people into discussion and decision-making processes, through the use of technological tools.
