            The aim of the project is to explore and analyse the possible development of the two main activities of Citizen OS and to define a roadmap for their implementation over the next 1-3 years. The main activities we will explore in the project are: 1) the possibilities of adding artificial intelligence to the existing platform; and; 2) taking on the role of a facilitator of online public debates in society.
