        term: account
        description: |
            Account, similar to many web services, is a collection of user's information, preferences and usage history. It is non-public and specific to a single user. An account can be created by the user or is created automatically by the system, if a user votes on a public topic using hard-ID (officially accepted electronic ID).

        term: activity feed
        description: |
            A chronological list of important activities customised for each individual user. Activity feed appears in several variations - under a specific group/topic, it shows activities/updates related to that group/topic. On user's Citizen OS dashboard it shows activities across all groups/topics that the user participates in. Actions displayed in the feed are, for example, if another user edits topic contents, votes on a topic, changes topic status etc.

        term: argument
        description: |
            An argument is like a comment or a post in any online discussion space. However, in Citizen OS users are invited to contribute more substantial opinions called arguments. An argument consists of a statement and supportive reasoning and examples to support that statement. An argument can be either for (pro) or against (con) the proposal in the topic. Use of arguments is a characteristic of a debate.

        term: author
        description: |
            Every topic in Citizen OS has a creator, authors and users. Authors are users, who have edited the topic body text. Users, who only vote on a topic or post arguments in a topic are NOT authors.

        term: Citizen OS
        description: |
            Citizen OS is an e-democracy and decisionmaking platform. It comprises a web service, an open source code and an open API. It is a proper name and as such, non-translatable. OS is an abbreviation of operating system.

        term: comment
        description: |
            During the topic creation phase, users with topic editing rights can select any part of text in the topic body and comment on it in the pop-up window, which opens when text is selected. The comment is only visible within the same group of admin & moderators.
    -
        term: creator
        description: |
            Every topic in Citizen OS has a creator (and may have multiple authors and users). A creator is a user who initially created the topic. A creator is always listed as one of the authors as well, regardless of whether they actually did edit the topic or not. A creator always receives full admin rights to the topic by default.
    -
        term: discussion
        description: |
            Discussion is a catchall term for arguments, replies and comments about a single topic, whether posted in-line or below the topic. To paraphrase, it's the "discussion about the main body of the topic".
    -
        term: eID
        description: |
            Also known as "hard ID" and "e-identification": the link between the online identity and the physical person behind it is verified to a high degree of certainty (as opposed to "social login", which allows you to log in via social networks and doesn't necessarily prove you're the one who you claim to be).

            This will require the user to identify themselves using an official electronic ID, such as the Estonian ID-card/mobile-ID/smart-ID.
    -
        term: follow-up
        description: |
            Follow-up means a stage for the topic to be in. A topic in Citizen OS can be in one of three different stages: in progress, in voting or in follow-up. Follow-up stage is the final stage, where users can post updates about how the decision, which was created and voted upon, is being put into force. Hence, authors can (should) "follow-up" on the implementation of the decision.

            For example, "Community proposals were discussed at the local municipality" could be an event/update, following up on how a decision made via Citizen OS is being implemented.

        term: group
        description: |
            Citizen OS has groups of users, who regularly decide together. If a number of users will only jointly decide on a single topic once, they could be invited to directly participate in the said topic. However, if they are likely to decide on multiple topics, it is easier to create a group, add the users to the group and then invite the group to participate in the topic. Making a group especially makes sense for users, who form groups outside of Citizen OS as well, such as villages, city districts, NGO members etc.

        term: in progress
        description: |
            "In progress" is a status/stage of the topic. A topic in Citizen OS can be in three different stages: in progress, in voting or in follow-up. "In progress" stage is the first stage, where users can discuss the proposal (comment, offer alternatives, edit wording etc.) that will later be voted on.
    -
        term: invite link
        description: |
            Admins can generate an invite link for their topic - every user with a Citizen OS account, who clicks on the link, will auto-join the topic and become its member. People without an account will be prompted with a login pop-up prior to being able to join the topic.

A private topic is visible only to people, that have been specifically invited to participate in that topic. It is not visible on Citizen OS public page. Often, users choose to first create a topic as a private topic, to prepare it with a smaller group of people and then make it public for everyone to work or vote on it.

        term: social login

            The "softer" kind of identification (compared to "eID"). In this case, the physical person behind an online identity is NOT verified and may or may not correspond to the displayed name. This allows the user to identify themselves by using Citizen OS login, a Google account, a Facebook account or other means of self-created, unofficial electronic identification.

        description: |
            A vote is a user's decision, given via Citizen OS, on the topic in question. Each user may have one or more votes per question, depending on the voting settings/options. Voting settings are defined by the admin who moves the topic into voting stage. A vote in Citizen OS is similar to the vote a citizen has in elections in a democratic country or in a shareholder's meeting.

            Voting means making and indicating a decision by the user via Citizen OS on the topic in question. To vote in Citizen OS means to choose one or more responses from a list of voting options. Options may be "Yes", "No", "Neutral" or other, customised phrases.   "
