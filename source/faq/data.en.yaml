            How does Citizen OS fund itself if the platform is free?
        text: |
            In the six years since its inception, Citizen OS's sources of revenue have been project-based grants and private donations.

            The majority of our running costs so far have been covered by a private philanthropist who is well-known in the Estonian technology field.

            Looking ahead, revenues from service fees, additional private donations and some additional paid features on the platform are possibilities we are exploring for the future.

            However, Citizen OS is and will always remain a social enterprise, meaning that it will remain non-profit oriented, and should profits ever be generated they will be reinvested into the organisation and the pursuit of our mission.
