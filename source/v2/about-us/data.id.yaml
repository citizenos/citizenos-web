      Citizen OS is a free and secure open source platform for citizen initiatives and collective decision-making. We are a not-for-profit organisation.

      Our mission is to bring decision-making back to the people and their communities, through nurturing e-democracy and developing innovative technologies for higher quality collaborative decision-making.

      Visit our [Vision](/vision/) and [Projects](/projects/) pages to find out more about why and what we do. Also, please see our [News](/news/) page for interviews / updates and check out our social media channels for inspiration.

      The Citizen OS platform went live in September, 2015. Since then, we have gained the trust of many public and private user groups around the world.

      We take the security of our platform very seriously - read more about this [here](/news/the-key-to-online-democracy-is-trust/) or view our [legal](/legal/) documents.
