                    To bring democracy closer to the people, we’ve developed an open source participation platform for citizens and communities.

                    On it, you can engage people across different locations and timezones to discuss and decide on the topics that affect their lives and well-being.

        text: |
            Our platform is designed for citizens and communities who value a diversity of opinions. It’s especially loved by civil society leaders who believe that everyone has the right to make their voice heard. While the below are our most common types of user, the platform is used by all kinds of groups. Schools, local governments, book clubs, friendship groups, families – you name it!

                    These changemakers use the Citizen OS platform to initiate public discussions and collect ideas on the topics that they stand for, be it the protection of flying squirrels, women rights or the ethics of AI. They send the result of the discussions to the local government or other decision-makers to amend the law or change regulations. They often also use the platform internally, to engage their members in decisions relating to their organisation.

                    Active citizens are the ones who raise difficult questions about the problems facing their communities, and invite their community members into the discussion on the Citizen OS platform. Whether it’s the local government´s proposed construction project or changes to the local bus schedule, active citizens take action to discuss and communicate their opinions to the decision-makers.

                    Smaller communities, such as neighbours in the same building, often discuss in private groups what to build on their empty yard, or decide on what kind of administrative service provider to contract.
