            What’s the issue?
        text: |
            We live in a world in which the **most important decisions** are primarily made by **a small group of highly privileged people**.

            The **quality of decisions** made by such narrow groups of individuals is often **highly unsatisfactory**, and even **damaging**.

            Decision-makers often have **little or no knowledge** of the topic in question, and **exclude the knowledge and desires** of the very people whose lives they affect the most – while they themselves remain entirely unaffected by their own misguided choices.

        text: |
            Thanks to **technological developments**, information is now **more freely and widely available, active participation is easier than ever** to facilitate, and **awareness of the right to be actively involved** as citizens is increasingly strong among the general population.

            Our mission is to **bring decision-making back to the people** and their communities, through **nurturing e-democracy** and **developing innovative technologies** for higher quality collaborative decision-making.
