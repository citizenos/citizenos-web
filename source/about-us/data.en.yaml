                Citizen OS is a free and secure open source platform for citizen initiatives. We are a not-for-profit organisation.

                We’re on a mission to change the world for the better - visit our [Vision](/vision/) and [Projects](/projects/) pages to find out why and how.

                The Citizen OS platform went live in September, 2015. Since then, we have gained the trust of many public and private user groups around the world.
